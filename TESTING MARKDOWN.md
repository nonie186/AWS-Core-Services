# AWS Lambda Service Notes

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events without requiring you to provision or manage servers. It is the core of **serverless architecture** on AWS.

## 1. Core Concepts & Terminology

- **Function**: The primary resource in Lambda; this is your code snippet (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java) that is executed.  
- **Event Source**: The AWS service or custom application that triggers the Lambda function (e.g., an S3 PUT event, an API Gateway request, a CloudWatch schedule).  
- **Execution Role (IAM Role)**: The permissions that the Lambda function assumes when it runs. This role dictates which other AWS services the function can interact with (e.g., writing logs to CloudWatch, reading from DynamoDB).  
- **Trigger**: The specific configuration connecting an event source to a Lambda function.  
- **Cold Start**: The delay experienced when a Lambda function is invoked for the first time in a while, as AWS needs to spin up the underlying container.  
- **Provisioned Concurrency**: A feature to keep functions initialized and ready to respond in double-digit milliseconds, mitigating cold starts for latency-sensitive applications.

## 2. Execution & Runtime Model

- **Stateless**: Functions should be designed to be stateless. Any persistent data should be stored in S3, DynamoDB, or RDS.  
- **Environment Variables**: Store configuration settings, database connection strings, or feature flags without hardcoding them into the function code.  
- **Ephemeral Disk Space (`/tmp`)**: Functions have access to temporary, writable disk space (up to 10 GB) available only during execution.  
- **Time Limit (Timeout)**: A single Lambda execution can run for a maximum of **15 minutes (900 seconds)**.

## 3. Pricing Model

Lambda is highly cost-effective because you pay only for the precise execution time your code consumes.

- **Pay per Requests**: Billed per million requests.  
- **Pay per Duration**: Billed in 1ms increments, calculated from the time your code starts executing until it returns or terminates.  
- **Free Tier**: Includes **1 million free requests per month**.

## 4. Integration Points (Event Sources)

Lambda integrates deeply with nearly all other AWS services. Common integrations include:

- **API Gateway**: Builds serverless APIs by triggering Lambda functions for HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).  
- **S3**: Triggers when objects are created, deleted, or modified in a bucket.  
- **DynamoDB Streams**: Processes changes in a DynamoDB table in near-real-time.  
- **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**: Processes messages in a queue asynchronously.  
- **CloudWatch Events / EventBridge**: Triggers on a schedule (cron jobs) or in response to specific AWS events.

## 5. Deployment and Operations

- **Deployment Packages**: Code is uploaded either as a ZIP file or a container image (since 2020).  
- **Layers**: Manage shared code, libraries, and custom runtimes separately from your main function logic. Keeps deployment packages small and promotes code reuse.  
- **Monitoring**: All logs are automatically sent to **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**. Metrics are sent to **Amazon CloudWatch**.  
- **VPC Configuration**: Lambda functions can be deployed inside a VPC to access private resources (like an RDS database). Requires careful configuration of ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) and security groups.  
- **Versioning and Aliases**: Manage different versions of your code (e.g., `$LATEST`, version 1) and use aliases (e.g., `PROD`, `BETA`) to route traffic to specific versions, enabling safe deployments and rollbacks.
